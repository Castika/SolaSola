# Dependencies for the isolated basic-pitch process.
# This environment requires numpy v1, which conflicts with the main application's
# dependencies (like whisperx).
numpy<2.0
# We install basic-pitch without the [tf] extra and explicitly add the
# much lighter tflite-runtime, which is sufficient for inference.
